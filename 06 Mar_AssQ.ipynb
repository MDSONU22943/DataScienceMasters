    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency and variability are common statistical tools used to summarize and describe datasets. These \n",
    "measures provide information about the typical values in the dataset and the spread of the data around the central value. \n",
    "Some common measures of central tendency and variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the most common measure of central tendency, which is the average of all the values in a dataset. It is\n",
    "calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive \n",
    "to extreme values, also called outliers, and can be affected by them, making it less useful when dealing with skewed \n",
    "distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is another measure of central tendency that is the middle value in a dataset when all the values are sorted\n",
    "in ascending or descending order. It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, making it a more robust measure of central\n",
    "tendency, especially when dealing with skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset. It is useful for categorical or discrete data, where there are only\n",
    "a limited number of possible values, and when the distribution is bimodal or multimodal, meaning that there are multiple values\n",
    "with the same highest frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is a measure of variability that represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "It is easy to calculate and interpret, but it is highly sensitive to outliers and may not provide an accurate representation of\n",
    "the spread of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is a measure of variability that represents the average distance of each data point from the mean of \n",
    "the dataset. It is calculated by subtracting each data point from the mean, squaring the differences, adding up the squared\n",
    "differences, and dividing by the number of observations. It is sensitive to outliers and may be influenced by extreme values, \n",
    "but it is useful in estimating the error of an estimator, which is a function of the data that estimates an unknown parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is also a measure of variability. It is \n",
    "widely used in many fields, and it measures how much the data deviates from the mean. It is more interpretable than the\n",
    "variance because it has the same units as the data, but it is still sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of central tendency and variability are essential tools in describing and summarizing datasets. The\n",
    "choice of measure depends on the type of data, the distribution of the data, and the research question at hand. It is essential\n",
    "to use multiple measures and to interpret them in conjunction with each other to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the\n",
