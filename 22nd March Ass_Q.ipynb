    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, we need to compute the covariance between the two variables and their standard deviations. Let's assume that we have n data points for studying time and final exam scores, denoted by x and y respectively. Then, the formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted by r, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (1/n) * Σ[(xᵢ - ȳ) * (yᵢ - ȳ)] / (sx * sy)\n",
    "\n",
    "where Σ is the sum over all i, xᵢ and yᵢ are the i-th values of x and y, respectively, ȳ is the mean of y, and sx and sy are the standard deviations of x and y, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables, while a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. A value of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores is positive, it means that there is a positive linear relationship between the two variables. In other words, as the amount of time students spend studying increases, their final exam scores also tend to increase. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the Pearson correlation coefficient is negative, it means that there is a negative linear relationship between the two variables. In other words, as the amount of time students spend studying increases, their final exam scores tend to decrease. A value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Pearson correlation coefficient allows us to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In the context of studying time and final exam scores, a positive correlation would suggest that students who study more tend to perform better on the exam, while a negative correlation would suggest the opposite."
