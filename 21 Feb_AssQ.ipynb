    "HTML Parsing: It can handle poorly-formed HTML and still parse it effectively, which is common when dealing with web pages that might not be perfectly structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction: It allows for the extraction of data by selecting elements based on tags, attributes, or text, making it useful for web scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with Other Tools: Beautiful Soup can be used in combination with libraries like requests for fetching web pages or pandas for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases:\n",
    "Web Scraping: Extracting data from web pages, such as headlines, prices, or reviews.\n",

    "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that's often used in web scraping projects to create a web interface or API for interacting with the scraping functionality. Hereâ€™s why Flask might be used in such a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a Web Interface\n",
    "Description: Flask can be used to build a web interface where users can input URLs or parameters for scraping. This interface can then trigger the scraping process and display results.\n",
    "Use Case: For a project where users need to interact with the scraper through a web form, Flask provides an easy way to set this up.\n",
    "2. Building an API\n",
    "Description: Flask can be used to create a RESTful API that allows other applications or services to request data from your web scraping scripts.\n",
    "Use Case: If you want to provide a service where users can programmatically request data scraping via HTTP requests, Flask makes it simple to set up such an API.\n",
    "3. Managing Scraping Tasks\n",
    "Description: Flask can be used to manage and monitor web scraping tasks, allowing users to start, stop, or schedule scraping operations through a web-based dashboard.\n",
    "Use Case: For more complex scraping projects where tasks need to be managed dynamically, Flask can serve as the control panel.\n",
    "4. Displaying Results\n",
    "Description: Flask can be used to present the scraped data in a web-based format, such as tables, charts, or downloadable files.\n",
    "Use Case: After scraping data, you might want to show it in a user-friendly way, and Flask provides the tools to build such a presentation layer."
