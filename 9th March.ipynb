    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two fundamental concepts in probability theory \n",

    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that a random\n",
    "variable X takes on a specific value x, and is denoted by P(X=x). The PMF is defined for each possible value of x, and the sum \n",
    "of all probabilities over all possible values of x is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the random variable X, which represents the value of the die, is given \n",
    "by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=1) = 1/6\n",

    "The PMF tells us that the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6, and so on. The sum of all \n",

    "\n",
    "The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It gives the probability density at \n",
    "each point in the range of possible values of the random variable. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the actual probability\n",
    "of a specific value, but rather the likelihood of a value falling within a range of values.\n",
