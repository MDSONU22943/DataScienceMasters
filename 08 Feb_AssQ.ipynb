    "Abstract Data Types: Abstract data types are data structures that define a set of operations that can be performed on the data,\n",

    "data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: An interface is a set of rules that define how an object can interact with the outside world. Interfaces allow\n",
