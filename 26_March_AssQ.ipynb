    "Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression establishes the relationship between two variables using a straight line. It attempts to draw a line that comes closest to the data by finding the slope and intercept which define the line and minimize regression errors. Simple linear regression has only one x and one y variable.\n",

    "Multi Linear Regression\n",
    "Multiple Linear regressions are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between both the dependent and independent variables or Predictor variable and Target variable. It also assumes that there is no major correlation between the independent variables. Multi Linear regressions can be linear and nonlinear. It has one y and two or more x variables or one dependent variable and two or more independent variables."

    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in\n",
    "a given dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. In other words, the slope of the regression line is constant across all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. That is, the value of the dependent variable for one observation is not influenced by the value of the dependent variable for any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals is the same across the range of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The errors are normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: There is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables. That is, there should not be a linear relationship between any two independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, we can perform various diagnostic tests. Some common diagnostic tests include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scatterplots: We can create scatterplots of the dependent variable against each independent variable to check for linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Residual plots: We can create residual plots to check for homoscedasticity. If the residuals are randomly scattered around zero, then the assumption of homoscedasticity is likely to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normal probability plots: We can create normal probability plots of the residuals to check for normality. If the residuals are normally distributed, then the points on the plot will fall along a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variance inflation factor (VIF): We can use the VIF to check for multicollinearity. A VIF greater than 5 is considered to indicate a significant degree of multicollinearity.\n",

    "price = intercept + slope * size\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the intercept represents the base price of a house, regardless of its size. The slope represents the change in price for every one-unit increase in the size of the house. So, if the slope is 100, that means that for every one square foot increase in size, the price of the house is expected to increase by $100.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a specific example, suppose we fit a linear regression model to a dataset of 100 houses and find that the intercept is $50,000 and the slope is $150. This means that the base price of a house, regardless of its size, is $50,000. For every one square foot increase in size, the price of the house is expected to increase by $150. So, a 1,000 square foot house would be expected to sell for $200,000 ($50,000 + $150 * 1,000), while a 2,000 square foot house would be expected to sell for $350,000 ($50,000 + $150 * 2,000)."

    "Q5. Describe the multiple linear regression model. How does it differ from simple linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that involves two or more independent variables in the model. In multiple linear regression, the goal is to find a linear relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple linear regression model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn + ε\n",
    "\n",
    "where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, β0 is the intercept, and β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients of the independent variables. ε is the error term, which represents the random variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients β1, β2, ..., βn represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other independent variables constant. The intercept β0 represents the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model, we use the method of least squares, which involves finding the values of the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have estimated the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model, we can use it to make predictions of the dependent variable based on values of the independent variables. We can also perform hypothesis tests to determine if the independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is a powerful tool for analyzing the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is widely used in many fields, such as economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences, to study the effects of various factors on a particular outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression differs from simple linear regression in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of independent variables: In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, whereas in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model equation: The model equation for simple linear regression is y = β0 + β1x + ε, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope coefficient, and ε is the error term. The model equation for multiple linear regression is y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn + ε, where x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and β1, β2, ..., βn are the corresponding coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretation of coefficients: In simple linear regression, the coefficient β1 represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. In multiple linear regression, the coefficients β1, β2, ..., βn represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model complexity: Multiple linear regression is a more complex model than simple linear regression because it involves more than one independent variable. As a result, multiple linear regression requires more data to estimate the coefficients accurately and to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of a multiple linear regression model is more complex than evaluating a simple linear regression model. In multiple linear regression, we need to consider the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable while controlling for the effects of the other independent variables. This can be done using techniques such as hypothesis testing, partial F-tests, and adjusted R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multiple linear regression is a more complex model than simple linear regression because it involves more than one independent variable. Multiple linear regression allows us to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables while controlling for the effects of other variables."

    "Q6. Explain the concept of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. How can you detect and\n",
    "address this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity is a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems when estimating the coefficients of the regression model because it makes it difficult to determine the unique effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity can also cause the standard errors of the coefficients to be inflated, leading to inaccurate hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. In extreme cases, it can even lead to unstable and unreliable coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods to detect multicollinearity in multiple linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlation matrix: A simple way to detect multicollinearity is to create a correlation matrix of the independent variables and check for high correlation coefficients. A correlation coefficient of 0.7 or higher is generally considered to indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): VIF measures the degree of correlation between an independent variable and the other independent variables in the model. A VIF value of 5 or higher indicates a high degree of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Eigenvalues: Another way to detect multicollinearity is to examine the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. If any eigenvalue is close to zero, it indicates that there is a linear combination of variables that is nearly collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once multicollinearity has been detected, there are several ways to address this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove one or more of the correlated variables: If two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, we can consider removing one or more of them from the model to reduce the multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Combine correlated variables: We can create a new variable by combining two or more correlated variables into a single variable. This can be done by taking the average, sum, or principal component of the correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularization techniques: Regularization techniques like Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression can be used to add a penalty term to the regression model to discourage multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multicollinearity is a common issue in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It can be detected using methods like correlation matrix, VIF, and eigenvalues. To address multicollinearity, we can remove correlated variables, combine correlated variables, or use regularization techniques."

In polynomial regression, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable raised to a certain power.\n",

    "- Polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables, which linear regression cannot.\n",

    "- The computation of polynomial regression models can be more complex and time-consuming compared to linear regression.\n",

    "In general, polynomial regression is preferred over linear regression when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is non-linear. Polynomial regression is also useful when we want to model a curve rather than a straight line. However, care must be taken when choosing the degree of the polynomial to avoid overfitting the data. If the degree of the polynomial is too high, the model may not generalize well to new data.\n",
