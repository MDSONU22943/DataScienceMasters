    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting and deploying web applications. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infrastructure**: Traditional web hosting typically involves hosting websites or applications on a single physical server or a dedicated server. The resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) are fixed and limited to the capacity of that specific server. In contrast, cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected virtual servers that draw resources from a pool of physical servers. This allows for scalability and flexibility as resources can be dynamically allocated based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: Traditional hosting has limited scalability because it relies on the capacity of a single server. If the website or application experiences increased traffic, the server may become overwhelmed, leading to performance issues or downtime. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, offers scalability by allowing the allocation of additional resources as needed. It enables you to scale up or down based on demand, ensuring that your application can handle increased traffic without interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Redundancy and High Availability**: Traditional hosting typically lacks redundancy, meaning that if the server fails, the website or application becomes inaccessible. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, often incorporates redundancy and high availability features. Data and applications are distributed across multiple servers and data centers, reducing the risk of downtime. If one server or data center fails, the workload can be shifted to other available servers, ensuring uninterrupted service.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Management**: In traditional hosting, you have a fixed amount of resources allocated to your server, regardless of whether you fully utilize them or not. With cloud hosting, you have more control over resource allocation. You can easily scale up or down the resources based on your requirements, allowing for efficient resource management and cost optimization. You pay for what you use, rather than a fixed monthly fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cost**: Traditional hosting often involves fixed monthly or annual fees, regardless of the actual resource usage. Cloud hosting follows a pay-as-you-go model, where you are billed based on the resources you consume. While cloud hosting can be cost-effective for applications with varying traffic patterns or seasonal fluctuations, traditional hosting may be more suitable for static or low-traffic websites that require predictable resource needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Management and Control**: In traditional hosting, you are responsible for managing and maintaining the server, including hardware upgrades, security patches, backups, and server configurations. With cloud hosting, the cloud service provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus more on developing and deploying your application. You have control over the application layer and can configure and manage your resources through a web-based control panel or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, cloud hosting offers greater flexibility, scalability, redundancy, and cost optimization compared to traditional hosting. It provides an infrastructure that can adapt to varying demands, ensuring high availability and performance for your web applications."
